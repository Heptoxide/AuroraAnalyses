Availability

The most recent kpyymm.tab (yymm stands for year and month, each expressed
with two digits) files are distributed per e-mail half-monthly by

     Juergen Matzka, mailto:kp_index@gfz-potsdam.de

Both recent and past tables (since 1994) are supplied as an archive on the FTP
servers

     Germany: ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/
     Denmark: ftp://ftp.space.dtu.dk/WDC/indices/kp-ap/

Further tables (since 1932) and background information on geomagnetic indices
and the classification of days can be found on this webpage (and links from
there): https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/kp-index/

Email distribution:

   * half-monthly distribution: days 1 through 15 and days 1 through 28 / 29
     / 30 / 31
   * monthly distribution: days 1 through 28 / 29 / 30 / 31

Format Description

This format is intended to be easily readable for both humans and computer
programs and have some resemblance to the regular mail distribution.

Since many observatories are interested mainly in the international quietest
and most disturbed days, beginning August 1996 three extra lines have been
added to the end of the table containing these values in an easy to read form.
The extra lines are included in the complete monthly tables only.

The geomagnetic indices in the kpyymm.tab files are supplied in the following
format.

Missing data is represented by blanks.

The table begins with the daily lines

Column  Format  Description
======  ======  ===========
 1- 2     i2    yy, last two digits of year
 3- 4     i2    mm, month (1-12)
 5- 6     i2    dd, day of month (1-31)
 8-19    4a3    3-hourly Kp indices, first 4 values
21-32    4a3    3-hourly Kp indices,  last 4 values
35-38     a4    Daily Kp sum (supplied only for tradition,
                              use Ap for scientific purposes!)
39-42     a4    Most disturbed and quiet days;
                Q: most quiet days (1-10, 10th quiet day is marked Q0)
                D: most disturbed days (1-5)
                A, K: not really quiet day
                *: not really disturbed day
43-45     i3    Ap index
46-50     f5.2  Cp geomagnetic index.

Either one line or four lines follow the daily lines

1. This line contains the monthly mean values for Ap and Cp

 1- 2     i2    yy, last two digits of year
 3- 4     i2    mm, month (1-12)
 5- 6     i2    day is blank, may be read as zero
39-42     a4    "Mean", denotes monthly mean average of Ap and Cp
43-45     i3    Ap index (monthly mean)
46-50     f5.2  Cp geomagnetic index (monthly mean).

Lines 2-4 in monthly distribution only

2. Empty line
3. This line contains the ordered most quiet days

 1- 2     i2    yy, last two digits of year
 3- 4     i2    mm, month (1-12)
 5- 6     a2    " Q"
 7-46   10a4    most quiet days 1 to 10 (day of month)
                A, K: not really quiet day

4. This line contains the ordered most disturbed days

 1- 2     i2    yy, last two digits of year
 3- 4     i2    mm, month (1-12)
 5- 6     a2    " D"
 7-26    5a4    most disturbed days 1 to 5 (day of month)
                *: not really disturbed day
